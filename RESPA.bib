	abstract = {Molecular dynamics has been used for decades to generate data from which thermodynamic properties as defined by statistical mechanics can be computed. Though very powerful, molecular dynamics contains at least two key inefficiencies: (1) It is common to compute all forces present in a system during every step forward in time, though many forces are slow to evolve and to repeatedly compute them only serves as vigorous CPU exercise. (2) Rare events such as the transition from one state in a free energy minimum to another state in another free energy minimum are as rare in simulations as they are in reality. Thus, simulations which are already inefficient due to (1) require long simulation times for interesting properties to be calculated accurately. In this dissertation, both of these issues are addressed with novel simulation algorithms and methods, and real systems such as liquid water, a small polypeptide in solvent, and a peptide antigen/cell surface protein complex in solvent are probed. It is shown that computation time for molecular dynamics can be decreased by over an order of magnitude with the SIN(R) molecular dynamics integrator, while preserving physical properties of the system of interest, and that the path-dAFED and path-UFED enhanced sampling algorithms can recover accurate free energy differences of states with minimal pre- and post-processing of data.},
